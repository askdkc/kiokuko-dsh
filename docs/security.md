# Embedding security

The local-small preset fixes the repository, full revision, required files,
sizes, and SHA-256 values. Arbitrary repositories, URLs, paths, extensions,
and remote code are not accepted. Files are verified before model loading;
staging is private and final installation is atomic.

Status, doctor, progress, and errors do not include memory text, query text,
credentials, redirect URLs, or absolute model paths. Legacy embedding
environment variables are detected by name only and are not used as runtime
configuration.
